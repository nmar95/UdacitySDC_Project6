# UdacitySDC_Project6
Project 1 of Term 2 of Udacity Self Driving Car Course

In this project, I utilized a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower that the tolerance outlined in the project rubric. (Px<0.11, Py<0.11, Vx<0.5, Vy<0.5)
